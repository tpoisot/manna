# sub-program `niche`

`niche` is a implementation of the niche model of food webs, also generating random carrying capacities based on species body sizes (see the preprint discussing this model to see how this is done).

```
niche S C
```

will generate a network of (exactly) `S` species, with (approximately) `C` connectance.

# sub-program `pop`

`pop` is an individual-based simulation model using the output of `niche` to
simulate network dynamics. The options are
